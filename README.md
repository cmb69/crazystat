This is an unofficial port of CrazyStat from Christosoft:

http://www.christosoft.de

This version is in no way affiliated to the original author.

I'm not a super-hardcore coder, but I intend to keep the program updated,
so it can be used to detect new browsers and operating systems.

I'll also try to get around issues with AdBlock (at the time of this writing,
this fork works better with AdBlock than the original version).

If you want to make the switch from the official CrazyStat version, follow these instructions:

 - Change all references from the /stat/ directory to the /zaehlen/ directory
 - Change all references from stat.php to zaehlen.php
